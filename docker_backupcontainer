## docker containers are very robust in the containerization environment which gives high assurity in production

# In some cases containers get rolled out when any issue is encountered so in that case taking backup of the containers are the best case to overcome out of this

# backup the containers

# you can take the backup of the container but you cannot save it as a backup_conatiner so in that case we can make backup_container as the new image and push it into the dockerhub


steps to be take :

1. docker ps (list of containers will display)

2. copy the containe_id 

3. docker commit -p <container_id> <image_name>

4. docker images [will display the local docker images here you can find out the docker backup image]

5. docker tag <image_name> <docker-hubusername/imagename>

6. docker push <docker-hubusername/imagename>

7. docker run -it --name containername --network network name -p<portnum:actualportnum> <docker-hubusername/imagename>
